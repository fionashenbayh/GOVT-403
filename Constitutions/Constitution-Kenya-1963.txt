 prescribed.
 231. (1) An elected councillor of a local government authority shall
 vacate his seat on that authority if any circumstances arise that, if he

 agreement in writing between the Presidents of the respective Regional
 Assemblies, alter that boundary in accordance with the provisions of this
 section.
 (2) No agreement to alter the boundary between two Regions shall
 have effect unless it is subsequently approved by a law made by the
 Regional Assembly of each of those Regions and, after both those laws
 have come into operation, by a resolution of each House of the National
 Assembly.
 (8) A Bill for a law under subsection (2) of this section shall not be
 passed by a Regional Assembly unless at the final reading of that Bill
 in the Regional Assembly it was supported by the votes of two thirds
 of all the members thereof.
 (4) An agreement made in pursuance of subsection (1) of this section
 shall, subject to the provisions of this Chapter, take effect on the date
 on which it is approved under subsection (2) of this section by resolution
 of the second House of the National Assembly to give such approval
 or on such later date as may be specified by or under the agreement.
 240. (1) Any agreement made in pursuance of section 239 of this
 Constitution shall (except in the case where the part of a Region that
 is to be transferred to another Region by virtue of the agreement consists
 of the whole of one or more Districts) include provision for altering the
 boundaries of the Districts in the two Regions in such manner as may
 seem to the Presidents of the two Regional Assemblies to be expedient
 in consequence of the alteration of the boundary between the two Regions:
 Provided that:
 (a) no District may be extinguished and no new District may be
 created as a result of any such alteration;
 (b) no alteration shall be made in the boundary of any District
 unless part of that District is to be transferred by virtue of the
 agreement or unless that District is contiguous to a District part of
 which is to be so transferred;
 (c) no part of a Region shall, as a result of any such alteration,
 not be included within a District; and

 representing that District in the Senate at the date when the alteration
 otherwise takes effect under section 239 (4) of this Constitution, but
 
 409
 
 
 if there is then no such Senator or if that Senator dies or otherwise
 vacates his seat before the expiration of his term of office, the alteration
 shall at once take effect for the purpose of elections to the Senate
 in that District.
 (3) For the purposes of section 238 of this Constitution a Senator shall,

 virtue of an agreement made in pursuance of section 239 of this Consti-
 tution shall not affect the seat of any member of the House of Repre-
 sentatives.

 boundary between two Regions has taken effect under section 239 (4)
 of this Constitution, review the number and boundaries of the consti-
 tuencies forming part of the two Regions under section 49 of this
 Constitution and, in accordance with the provisions of the said section
 49, make, by order, such alteration therein as it considers desirable in
 the light of the alteration of the Regional boundary and in the light
 of the review and, in particular, shall make such alteration therein as is
 necessary or expedient to secure that no constituency shall form part
 of more than one Region; but the order made by the Electoral Com-
 mission shall not take effect for the purpose of elections to the House
 of Representatives in the Regions concerned or for the purpose of
 elections of Specially Elected Members of that House until the next
 dissolution of Parliament after the making of the order.
 242. (1) A law made by a Regional Assembly under section 239 (2)

 of the number or the boundaries of the constituencies into which the several
 Districts within the Region are divided, in accordance with section 93 (2)
 of this Constitution, for the purpose of electing Elected Members to the
 Regional Assembly: Provided that that law shall include such provision
 as is necessary to give effect to paragraph (b) of the proviso to section 104
 of this Constitution.
 (2) Subject to the provisions of subsections (3), (4) and (5) of this
 section, any alteration of the number or boundaries of constituencies
 that is made in pursuance of subsection (1) of this section by any law
 shall not affect the seat of any member of the Regional Assembly and
 shall not, until the next dissolution of the Regional Assembly after
 the alteration of the Regional boundary that is approved by that law
 has taken effect under section 289 (5) of this Constitution, take effect

 sequence of the alteration of a Regional boundary consists of or includes
 the whole of one or more constituencies, the member of the Regional
 Assembly of the Region from which that area is transferred who
 represents any such constituency shall, at the date on which the
 alteration of the Regional boundary takes effect under section 239 (4)
 of this Constitution, cease to be a member of that Regional Assembly
 and shall instead become a member of the Regional Assembly of the
 other Region as if he had been elected as such under the provisions of
 this Constitution and notwithstanding that, under this Constitution or
 any other law relating to elections to that other Regional Assembly, he
 may not be qualified to be elected as such; and, until that other Regional
 Assembly next stands dissolved, he shall not vacate his seat therein
 unless any circumstances arise that, if he had remained a member of
 the former Regional Assembly, would have caused him to vacate his
 seat as such.
 (4) Where the area transferred from one Region to another in con-
 sequence of the alteration of a Regional boundary consists of part only
 of one or more constituencies or includes, in addition to the whole of
 one or more constituencies, part only of one or more constituencies,
 that area or, as the case may be, the part of that area that consists
 of part only of one or more constituencies shall, as soon as is practicable
 after the alteration in the Regional boundary has taken effect under
