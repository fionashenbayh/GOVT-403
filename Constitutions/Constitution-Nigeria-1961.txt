 rule of law or a provision of an Act of Parliament or of a Law made by the

 Region.
 (2) The appropriate authority may, at any time during the period of
 three years beginning with the date aforesaid, by order make such
 changes in the text of any such provision as is mentioned in subsection (1)

 in relation to any provision:
 (a) in so far as the provision forms part of the law of a Region, the

 commencement of this Constitution, was held by the Crown or by some
 other body or person (not being an authority of the Federation) on behalf
 of or in trust for the Crown shall on that date, by virtue of this subsection
 and without further assurance, vest in the President and be held by him
 on behalf of, or as the case may be on the like trusts for the benefit of,
 
 Nigeria
 
 665
 
 
 the Government of the Federation; and all property which, immediately
 before the date aforesaid, was held by an authority of the Federation
 on behalf of or in trust for the Crown shall be held by that authority
 on behalf of, or as the case may be on the like trusts for the benefit of,
 the Government of the Federation.
 (2) References to the Crown in subsection (1) of this section are refer-
 ences to the Crown in right of the Government of the Federation; and
 that subsection shall, with the necessary modifications, apply in relation
 to rights, liabilities and obligations arising out of a contract or other
 arrangement as it applies in relation to property.
 (3) Subject to the provisions of subsection (4) of this section, any pro-
 ceedings on appeal from a decision of the Federal Supreme Court which
 are pending immediately before the date of the commencement of this
 Constitution may be continued on or after that date as if this Consti-
 tution had not been passed and any decision given in pursuance of any
 such proceedings shall have effect accordingly, so however that any such
 proceedings which are still pending at the expiration of the period of one
 year beginning with that date shall abate on the expiration of that period.
 (4) Where immediately before the date of the commencement of this
 Constitution any proceedings on appeal from a decision of the Federal
 Supreme Court are pending or any right to bring such proceedings has
 accrued, the proceedings or right shall abate on that date in so far as any
 question for determination in the relevant proceedings is:
 (a) a chieftaincy question; or
 (b) a question as to the interpretation of a constitution or former
 constitution of the Federation or a Region or as to the validity of an
 enactment which amends or purports to amend such a constitution;
 and where immediately before that date any proceedings are pending
 in any court in Nigeria or any right has accrued to bring proceedings on
 appeal to such a court, the proceedings or right shall abate on that date
 in so far as any question for determination in the relevant proceedings is
 a chieftaincy question.
 (5) Any debt of the Federation which immediately before the date of
 the commencement of this Constitution was, by virtue of any provision
 repealed by subsection (1) of section 154 of this Constitution, charged
 on the revenues and assets of the Regions as well as on the revenues
 and assets of the Federation shall, on and after that date, continue to be
 so charged.
