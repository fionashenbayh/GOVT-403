The Constitution of Sierra Leone,-1978

Being aa Act to make Provision for a One Party Republican Constitution for Sierra Leone

[14th June, 1978.]

Whereas we the people of Sierra Leone are conscious that we are governed and guided by Almighty God and believe in the Divine protection of our Nation by Almighty God:

And whereas for over a period of one hundred and fifty years Siena Leona was subjected to the rule and domination ©f Great Britain:

And whereas the indigenous culture and political system of SicFra Leone before the British came was based on mutual brotherhood and interdependency of all the inhabitants without any division in political or other factions:

And whereas the British during the period of their coloniali-sation of this country governed Sierra Leone under an authoritarian system which did not tolerate any political opposition, but nevertheless they required us to adopt a multi-party system (with an inbuilt opposition element) as a sine qua non to the granting of independence; all of which tantamounted to our adopting a political system completely at variance with the system which the British had practised with us:

And whereas on the 27th April. 1961 Sierra Leone achieved independence from Britain:

And whereas throughout the first years of our independence we experimented with the multi-party system of Government;

And whereas our experience of such experimentation has been the intensification of personal disharmonies, communal factions, tribal animosities, international misunderstandings, and military take-overs:

And whereas on the 26th April, 1968, we the people of Sierra Leone decided to end the military regime and to establish the All People’s Congress as the Government of Sierra Leone:

And whereas between 1968 and 1971 the multi-party system continued to breed disharmonies, dissensions, political instability, political unrest and economic problems in Sierra Leone:

And whereas wc the people of Sierra Leone through our duly elected representatives and in due process of law transformed Sierra Leone from a monarchy under the British system into a freely independent Republic on the 19th April, 1971:

And whereas we the people of Sierra Leon* conscious of the outstanding contributions of the All People’s Congress towards the peace, progress and development of Sierra Leone are satisfied that we should now introduce a One Party System of Government in Sierra Leone under tb« aegis of the All People’s Congress:

And whereas we the people of Sierra Leone believe that a Ono Party System of Government will promote peace, will foster unity, will encourag* economic development and facilitate political progress in Sierra Leone:

And whereas we are satisfied that when men are united together in our community it is their duty to respect the rights and dignity of their fellow men, to uphold the laws of the State, and to conduct the affairs of the State so that its resources are preserved, developed and enjoyed for the benefit of all its citizens as a whole aad so as to prevent the exploitation of man by man:

And whereas we are convinced that such rights are best maintained and protected and such duties are most equitably discharged in a One Party democratic society where «very citizen is entitled to participate in the effective government of the nation, rather than in opposition thereto: and where the Government is responsible to freely elected Parliamentary Representatives of the people with opportunities for participation by all sectional interests, and where the Courts of Law are free and impartial:

And whereas we are conscious of the dearth of citizens with the requisite calibre to run the affairs of Government in a modern state; And determined as we ure to utilise to the fullest all our available talents, we cannot at this stage, afford to divide the limited human resources at our disposal into a “ Government ” and an “ Opposition ”:

And whereas we recognise that the All People’s Congress is and will continue to be the leading and guiding political force and the revolutionary mass in which African democracy evolved by and involving all the citizens will be strictly maintained, welded together by patriotism and the voluntary acceptance of a sense of belonging:

And whereas we are determined to mould a new Sierra Leone in which equity, justice, liberty, solidarity, peace and political, economic and social progress and prosperity and development for all shall reign, free from poverty, disease ignorance and exploitation:

And whereas we are committed to the principle of affording the fullest protection to all friends of Sierra Leone who come to assist us economically, socially and financially in our striving towards maximum development, we are in duty bound at all times to give the utmost consideration and protection to all persons or

organisations who are willing to invest their capital or expertise in our country:

And whereas we are desirous to establish ties of friendship with all peoples of the world on the basis of the principles of equality, mutual interest, and respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity:

And whereas we are committed to maintain permanent world peace under the principles of the Organisation of African Unity and the United Nations Organisation so as to help in ensuring the security, liberty and happiness of all the peoples of the world and our posterity externally:

And whereas we are conscious of our responsibilities before God and the Nation:

Therefore we the people of Sierra Leone proclaim this One Party Republican Constitution whose text is as follows:
