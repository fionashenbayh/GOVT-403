â€œINTERIM CONSTITUTION of TANZANIA'
 11th July, 1965
 Whereas freedom, justice, fraternity and concord are founded upon the recognition of the equality of all men and of their inherent dignity, and upon the recognition of the rights of all men to protection of life, liberty and property, to freedom of conscience, freedom of expression and freedom of association, to participate in their own government, and to receive a just return for their labors:
 And when men are united together in a community it is their duty to respect the rights and dignity of their fellow men, to uphold the laws of the State, and to conduct the affairs of the State so that its resources are preserved, developed and enjoyed for the benefit of its citizens as a whole and so as to prevent the exploitation of one man by another:
 And whereas such rights are best maintained and protected and such duties are most equitably disposed in a democratic society where the government is responsible to a freely elected Parliament representative of the People and where the courts of law are free and impartial:
 Now therefore this Constitution, which makes provision for the Government of Tanzania as such a democratic society is hereby enacted by the Parliament of the United Republic of Tanzania.
