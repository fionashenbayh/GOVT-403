Welcome to the course site for GOVT 403: Digital Dictatorships.

One of the main challenges to studying dictatorship is a lack of data on how these regimes truly operate. Yet, recent advances in data science present new opportunities to research autocratic politics from a variety of digital platforms. This course introduces students to new data methods to analyze autocratic politics.

## Learning objectives:

- Explore the digital landscape of autocratic regimes
- Collect "big data" from online sources
- Leverage "text as data" methods
- Develop academic and/or policy-relevant research
