# About

Welcome to the course site for GOVT 403: Digital Dictatorships. Lectures and assignments will be regularly uploaded to this space.

# Background

Dictatorship is one of the oldest forms of government in the world. In fact, theories of dictatorship are as old as political science itself and have long informed our understanding of power, violence, and inequality in both autocracies and democracies alike. In recent years, however, dictators have adapted to shifting political terrain, developing new ways of overcoming threats and asserting control. This is particularly the case in the digital sphere, where new internet technologies and social media platforms have profoundly altered how politics operate and peoples interact.

Studying these changes is crucial for understanding how modern dictatorships work. Yet, one of the main challenges to studying dictatorship – both then and now – is a lack of data on how these regimes truly operate. But recent advances in data science present new opportunities to research autocratic politics from a variety of digital platforms. 

This course considers *digital dictatorship* from two dimensions – as both a strategy of autocratic survival (digital tools of control), and as a method of empirical inquiry (“big data” on autocratic politics).
