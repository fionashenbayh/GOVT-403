Welcome to the course site for GOVT 403: Digital Dictatorship! Course content will be regularly uploaded to this space.

# Background

Dictatorship is one of the oldest forms of governance in the world. In fact, theories of autocratic rule have long informed our understanding of power, violence, and inequality, in both dictatorships and democracies alike. But modern technologies have complicated the ways in which dictatorships operate, as well as presented new opportunities to study these regimes from different vantage points. 

This course considers *digital dictatorship* from two dimensions---as both a strategy of autocratic survival (digital tools of control) and as a method of empirical inquiry (digital data on autocratic politics).
