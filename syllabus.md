**Week 2: Defining dictatorship**
{: .label }

What is dictatorship? 

1.	Tullock, G. (1987) Autocracy: Chapter 1, “Introduction”
2.	Olson, M. (1993). Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development. The American Political Science Review, 87(3), 567-576. doi:10.2307/2938736
3.	Geddes, B. (1999). What do we know about Democratization after 20 years?

*Questions to keep in mind: based on these readings, what is the most generic definition of autocracy you can come up with? Which parts of these canonical theories seem outdated; which parts seem timeless? Do empirical trends seem historical contingent or are there patterns that resonate with what we see today?*

What is digital dictatorship?


1.	Kendall-Taylor, A., Frantz, E., & Wright, J. (2020). The digital dictators: How technology strengthens autocracy. Foreign Affairs, 99(2), 103-115.
2.	Gunitsky, S. (2015). Corrupting the Cyber-Commons: Social Media as a Tool of Autocratic Stability. Perspectives on Politics, 13(1), 42-54. doi:10.1017/S1537592714003120
3.	Guriev, Sergei, and Daniel Treisman. (2019). Informational Autocrats. Journal of Economic Perspectives, 33 (4): 100-127. DOI: 10.1257/jep.33.4.100

*Questions to keep in mind: does “digital” dictatorship seem to refer to something that is fundamentally different to dictatorships of eras past? Or are there more commonalities than differences? What kinds of data do these authors refer to? Does this data help us answer new questions; old questions?*

**Week 3: Theories of Dictatorship**

Rules of the Game
1.	Machiavelli, The Prince
2.	De Mesquita et al. The Dictator’s Handbook, Chapter 1: “Rules of Politics” (blackboard)
3.	Wintrobe, R. (2012). Autocracy and coups d'etat. Public Choice, 152(1/2), 115-130. www.jstor.org/stable/41483757

*Questions to keep in mind: How do you think these theories of autocratic rule originate? Do these authors use data to back their claims? What is their empirical strategy – if there is one? Why do you think these authors made these decisions re: empirics?*

*Questions to keep in mind: What value do archival data provide for the study of dictatorship? What are the drawbacks of these sources – how much (or little) information do you think we can glean about dictatorship from historical records?*
